VERSIONING SCHEME

V KR (Knexus Research) X.Y.Z
X = External entity release
Y = Paralax Release
Z = Internal versioning

V KR 1.10.15 (12/11 week)
=======================
> Tiebreakers for same values now in justifications


V KR 1.9.14 (11/28 week)
=======================
> Returns an english string decision justification, as well as JSON values
> Handles new supplies (no effect, no crashing)
> Refined decision justification output for edge cases (end scenario, etc)

V KR 1.8.13 (11/22 before Thanksgiving)
=======================
> Adjust severity to not be divided by total so decimals are visible
> Fixed numberic names rendering incorrectly in decision justifications
> Added justification to analysis dict, returns from driver
> Decisions in analysis are now sorted by SortableDecision class
> Removed end_scenario action from comparisons because of unintrestingness
> Refactored monte carlo analyzer to use helper util module
> Dynamically setting vitals like max blood/breath hp based on the demographics of the casualty 

V KR 1.8.12 (11/20 week begin)
=======================
> Probability death triss calculated
> Fixed driver and montecarlo sim outputting errors in superlow rollout numbers
> Added Knexus jedi tester script
> Added decision justifications

V KR 1.7.11 (11/13 week begin)
========================
> TA1 client incorperated
> Burn death and burn suffocation are sepearated, so that a nasopharengeal airway decreases asphyxiation chances in
  burn victims now.
> Updated justifications

V KR 1.6.10 (Veterans day week)
=========================
> Added genericized metrics instead of mass casualty specific as default flag
> Sorting of metrics by damage per second (deterioration per second?)


V KR 1.5.9 (11/6 BOW)
=========================
> Updated justifications to use morbidity/bleedout
> Updated command line args for knexus branches to see reduced output
> Updated TMNT/Simple scene drivers to be compatible with TA3 state changes
> Fixed delta in metric glitch from incorrect parameter order
> Future state is now average of future states in mc analyzer, not most likely state
> Added Eye Trauma injury
> Fixed typo


V KR 1.5.8 (10/27 EOW)
=========================
> Updated Medical simulator. Major change provides much more accurate values for reasoning
> Legacy keys remian, but new helpful keys include: MEDSIM_P_DEATH, MEDSIM_P_BLEEDOUT, MEDSIM_P_ASPHYXIA,
  EST_BLOOD_LOSS, EST_LUNG_LOSS, as well as the HIGHEST version of all of these
> Major refactoring of med simulator
> Added flag to tad_tester to turn off output from kdma estimator with decision_verbose flag (left extended output on for now)

V KR 1.4.7 (10/23 BOW)
=========================
> Added in justification about injuries and overall scene



V KR 1.3.5 (10/18 midweek patch)
=========================
> Major rewrite of Monte Carlo Analyzer class:
  > Returns new metrics for target severity/change, and severest casualty severity/change
  > Values have been normalized for number of time units taken
> __init__.py removed from scrips file to fix scripts running "illegally" in pycharm



V KR 1.2.3 (10/16 changes)
=========================
Changes:
> Monte Carlo Decision Analyzer is no longer calculating casualty severity twice.
> Probe names refactored
> TA3 past action / treatments are refactored out of driver class
> Removed non-working metrics while target/worst severity metrics are being built



V KR 1.1.3A (oops) (10/10 Internal changes)
=========================
Monte Carlo Changes-
> replace score averager with weighted average
> children nodes that are chosen more frequently have a greater affect on the node's score

'Cause these things will change, Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come, For us to finally win;
And we'll sing hallelujah"
