Nice! Having the bayesian network in so quick is no small task well done. I've added a few # TODOs as I went along,
But mostly from a code quality and readability standpoint. Main recurring comment is code readability, and using ENUMs,
Not hardcoding paths, and more descriptive variable names/documentation describing variable. Nothing unexpected here
on our quick timeline. Good code, thank you for allowing me to review.
