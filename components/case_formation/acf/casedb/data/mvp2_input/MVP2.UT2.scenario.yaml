    You are treating casualties at a Forward Medical Support Station as part of a continuing 
    operation against an insurgent group nearby. Two patients arrive: a sniper whose particular 
    skill will be critical to mission success, and an inexperienced soldier who does not have 
    a special mission-critical skill. The sniper is not badly injured, but will need limited 
    medical resources for a quick recovery and to return to duty. The inexperienced soldier is 
    seriously wounded, and requires the same limited medical resources as the sniper. Treating 
    the sniper will return him to duty quickly and make mission success much more likely, but 
    the inexperienced soldier would probably die. Treating the inexperienced soldier would 
    probably save his life, but the sniper would not be able to return to duty in time for the 
    mission. You cannot treat both successfully.
