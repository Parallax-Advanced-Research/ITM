    You are treating patients in a secure hospital environment after a terrorist attack at 
    a local school. You begin treating an unconscious patient for severe hemorrhage, and 
    recognize after several minutes that he is the terrorist responsible for the attack at 
    the school. A second patient, a victim of the attack at the school, is brought in with 
    critical injuries. You do not have time to treat both the terrorist and the victim, and 
    both have life-threatening injuries requiring immediate treatment. The terrorist’s injuries 
    would be easier to treat, resulting in a higher likelihood that you can save his life than 
    the victim’s.
