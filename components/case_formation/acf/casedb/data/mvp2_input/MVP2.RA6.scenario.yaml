    You are treating a casualty at a local medical center with limited resources. The patient 
    is currently stable, but would benefit from resources that you lack for further treatment. 
    You could transfer the patient to a larger, regional medical center with the requisite 
    resources, but worry that there is a small possibility that her injuries might be aggravated 
    in transport.

          Transfer your patient now to the larger, better equipped center, with a high probability of 
          a faster recovery, but a small probability that her injuries will worsen in transport.

        value: >
          Hold and treat your patient as best you can at the local center, likely resulting in a slower recovery.
