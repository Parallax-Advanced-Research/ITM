    You are treating a patient at a secure field hospital. She has a serious shrapnel injury 
    that will require a complicated surgery that you have not performed before. You are 
    confident that you would succeed, but there is a low risk of seriously aggravating the injury. 
    Alternatively, you could delay treatment and wait until a colleague arrives who has performed 
    the operation before. This will mean that the patientâ€™s condition will worsen, but she will 
    be better off than if you performed the operation incorrectly.
