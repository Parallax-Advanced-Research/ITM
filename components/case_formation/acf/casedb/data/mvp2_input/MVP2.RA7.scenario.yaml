    You are treating an unconscious patient with severe sepsis, at a remote location with limited 
    resources. Ordinarily, you would use an antibiotic to combat the infection. However, the limited 
    data you have on the patientâ€™s medical history suggests that he may be allergic to the only 
    antibiotic drug available in sufficient quantity.
