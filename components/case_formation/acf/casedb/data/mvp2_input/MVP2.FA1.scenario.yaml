    You are the only medic nearby, and you are called over to assess and treat two casualties from the 
    military vehicle that took the brunt of the damage. You see a wounded civilian, who works for your 
    base as a mechanic. He is not moving, is lying on his side, and has minor burns to the arms as well 
    as bruising to the head and neck. He looks about 30-40 years old. You also see a wounded member of 
    your own unit, Mike, who you just ate lunch with an hour ago. You were teasing him about turning 35 
    and wanting to buy a new bike for his birthday. Mike is lying on his back, and is also not moving. 
    You call out to both of them to raise their arm if they can hear you, but neither responds.
