    You have a patient at the medic tent who has been receiving IV antibiotics for a persistent skin 
    infection (cellulitis). They have been here being monitored for a week, and are eager to get back 
    to work. Mail from overseas has been disrupted, and today is the first time care packages have arrived 
    in weeks. Your patient’s buddy just brought them a package from home, full of their favorite junk 
    food. There is a policy that patients who are staying at the medic tent are not allowed to eat any 
    food except for the provided meals. You know this is because some conditions can be aggravated by 
    particular foods, but you are certain that cellulitis wouldn’t be affected by snack foods.
