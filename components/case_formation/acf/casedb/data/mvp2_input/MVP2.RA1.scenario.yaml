    You are treating casualties at a field hospital, with a less experienced soldier 
    assisting you. Six combat injuries arrive due to an unexpected attack. You cannot 
    treat all the patients by yourself. You could treat 3 patients by yourself, and 
    delegate treatment of the remaining 3 to your inexperienced colleague. This would 
    let you focus your attention carefully on those 3 patients. Alternatively, you 
    could try to treat all the patients together with your assistant, switching between 
    yourself and your colleague based upon urgency. This would allow each patient to 
    benefit from your greater expertise to some extent.
