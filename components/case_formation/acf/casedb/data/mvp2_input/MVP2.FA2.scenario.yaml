    After the first medical evaluation of the most urgently injured casualties, you are monitoring 
    two remaining patients at the casualty collection point. Patient 1 is your unit’s translator, 
    Hassan. You’ve worked with Hassan for a year, and he’s helped your commander navigate the complex 
    web of local relationships to achieve security and stability mission goals. You’ve met his wife 
    and three young children at the village market, where they gave you ripe mangos. Patient 2 is 
    another civilian you don’t know. Hassan is clutching his shoulder and was limping. His breathing 
    and pulse are normal. He’s been brought in because he seems dazed and isn’t able to follow simple 
    commands. TBI is suspected. The other civilian has some chest and neck injuries. The bleeding is 
    now minor. He was already treated with a chest seal. He’s been brought in because of concerns 
    about respiration and the potential for shock. His breathing and pulse are normal now.
