    Your unit is executing a counterinsurgency mission in an area where medical evacuation 
    flights are only sporadically available. In the last month, there has been a high rate 
    of hostile engagement and almost every day there has been a casualty with serious injuries 
    that needed transport to a higher level hospital. Because the medical transport flight 
    has only been able to reach you once or twice a week, and it can only take 2 casualties 
    at once, a number of these patients have died while waiting. One seriously injured patient 
    is ready for transport when the flight arrives. The longer they wait for surgery, the lower 
    their chances for a full recovery and the higher their chances are for a permanent 
    disability. The flight has been full on every trip during the last two months, and you’ve 
    had to make many difficult decisions about who to put on the flight. The flight can either 
    leave right now or wait 18 hours.

      Before the flight leaves, your commander radios to tell you that there is a mission launching in 
      3 hours, which is anticipated to result in casualties, so that you can be prepared. What do you do?

      Before the flight leaves, you get another call telling you that there was just a skirmish, 
      resulting in one seriously injured casualty. Their platoon is hurrying back to your location 
      right now, but will take enough time to reach you that the flight would miss the current 
      window for leaving. What do you do?
