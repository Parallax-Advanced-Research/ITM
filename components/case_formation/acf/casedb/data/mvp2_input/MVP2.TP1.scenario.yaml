    After a nearby explosion, you come across a wounded civilian lying on the ground 
    on his side. He has significant torso trauma from impact. He is conscious and has 
    a pulse in the normal range. His breathing is very labored and fast, and he is 
    too out of breath to speak.

    options:
      - id: MVP2.TP1.1.A # string, globally unique response ID
        value: This seems like tension pheumothorax, and a needle decompression is required. # string, response
      - id: MVP2.TP1.1.B
        value: This seems like hypothermia, and the priority is wrapping him in an active heating blanket.
      - id: MVP2.TP1.1.C
