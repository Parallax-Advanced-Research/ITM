    You are monitoring two casualties in a temporary casualty collection point, awaiting medical evacuation. 
    One casualty has intense pain from extensive burns and the other has intense pain from a crushing injury 
    to their foot. They report similar pain levels and you want to treat them both with an oral pain medication, 
    but you have only one OTFC lozenge available. There is a policy that you should never split doses of an 
    oral medication. You know this is because some medications have a time release coating that will be 
    deactivated by splitting, but you are certain that OTFC lozenges do not have such a coating.
