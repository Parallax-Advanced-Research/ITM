    In a remote field care environment, you are treating a local translator who has been 
    crucial to the success of several operations. He had been assured by your unit that 
    injury was unlikely in the villages where he would be working as a translator, and that 
    he would receive excellent medical care in the event of any injury. When he was 
    unexpectedly injured in an IED attack, you promised his brother that you would take care 
    of him. Now three additional casualties arrive with critical wounds. The new casualties’ 
    injuries are very serious but quick and easy to stabilize, whereas the translator’s 
    injuries will require more time and resources to treat. You cannot save both the translator 
    and the new arrivals. If you treat the translator, the three new arrivals will probably 
    die. If you switch from treating the translator in order to treat the new arrivals, you 
    would violate your promise to his brother and the translator would probably die.
