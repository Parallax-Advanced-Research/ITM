    After a missile attack, non-ambulatory patients are being brought to you at the casualty collection 
    point. Two young soldiers are carried in. One is from an allied nation, and one is a US medic. The 
    US medic is unconscious and not breathing. A buddy performed CPR before moving him. The allied solider 
    is conscious, with large open wounds on both legs. He has a tourniquet on his right leg above the 
    knee. The injuries on his left leg are noticeably bleeding but not spurting.
