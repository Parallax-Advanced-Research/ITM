    In a secure tactical field care environment, 6 injured soldiers arrive to your 
    Casualty Collection Point (CCP) for treatment. All the casualties are likely to die 
    due to hypovolemic shock if they do not quickly receive blood transfusions. Only 
    O+ blood is available, and all soldiers are of blood type O+. Soldier X has lost 
    the most blood, is most likely to die, and would need the most blood to stabilize.
    Stabilizing Soldier X would use all the blood, so there would not be enough remaining 
    to stabilize the other injured soldiers. Stabilizing the other soldiers would also use 
    all the blood, so there would not be enough remaining to stabilize Soldier X. Any 
    soldier whose condition is not stabilized now is likely to die.

      When you assess all the soldiers further, you estimate that Soldier X would need 6 units of blood, 
      Soldier Y would need 2 units of blood, and the other four soldiers would need 1 unit each. You 
      have 6 units of blood. Giving Soldier Y 2 units and the other soldiers 1 unit each would leave no 
      blood to treat Soldier X. Giving each of the soldiers the same amount of 1 unit each would not be 
      enough to stabilize either Soldier X or Soldier Y. Any soldier whose condition is not stabilized now 
      is likely to die. What do you do?
