    After an attack, members of your unit are being brought into a casualty collection point. 
    You know that there are several victims with severe bleeding. Because of damage 
    to your own supplies, you have only 5 packages of hemostatic gauze that you can use to 
    stop severe bleeding. The first patient that arrives has several serious injuries, and 
    you estimate that you will need all 5 packages because of the locations of the injuries. 
    You have stopped bleeding in one area when 4 other members of the unit arrive. The unit 
    members transporting them report that each has one seriously injured area that requires 
    this treatment to stop bleeding. If you continue to treat the more seriously injured 
    patient, you will use all 4 remaining packages to save his life, but the other units 
    members would die. If you stop treating the current patient, allowing him to die, you could 
    save the other 4 injured unit member with the 4 remaining packages.
