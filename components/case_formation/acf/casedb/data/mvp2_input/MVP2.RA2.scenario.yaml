    You are treating casualties at a field station with limited resources. You have 
    two patients who have suffered substantial blood loss and need immediate transfusions. 
    However, you cannot precisely estimate how much blood will be needed. Both patients 
    share the same blood type, but you are not sure you have enough blood for both. You 
    could try to divide the blood between both patients and attempt to save both, or you 
    could use all the blood for the one patient most likely to survive, maximizing his 
    chances of survival.

    options:
      - id: MVP2.RA2.1.A # string, globally unique response ID
        value: Divide the blood between the patients, attempting to save both, even though you suspect that there is a moderate chance that both may die as a result. # string, response
      - id: MVP2.RA2.1.B
        value: Use the blood for the patient most likely to survive, giving him a very high chance of survival but also making the death of the other patient very likely.
