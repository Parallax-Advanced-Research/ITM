    You are a medic deployed in a submarine. You are called to respond to a chemical explosion in 
    the area where equipment maintenance supplies are stored. When you get there, an emergency door 
    is closed, sealing off the compartment where the explosion occurred. A maintenance specialist 
    tells you that he came out of the compartment before the door automatically shut, to get help 
    for his colleague, who was seriously burned on the face and neck. You know that there is a 
    risk of toxic fumes from whatever chemical exploded, or from damage to nearby containers. 
    The maintenance specialist tells you that nothing else was damaged or leaking, and that the 
    solvent that exploded isnâ€™t toxic.

          Get a gas mask, close the door leading into this area, and then open the emergency door and 
          enter the compartment. This will allow you to treat the injured submariner sooner, but risks 
          at least a local release of toxic fumes.

        value: >
          Wait for the chemical/biological/radiation response team to come and install a mobile airlock 
          entrance before entering the compartment with a gas mask. This will delay treatment for the 
          injured submariner but reduce the risk of toxic fume release.
