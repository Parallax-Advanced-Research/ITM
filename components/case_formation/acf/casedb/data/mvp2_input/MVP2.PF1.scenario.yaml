    You are at a casualty collection point at the site of a building collapse after an earthquake. 
    The protocol for this multi-agency/multi-organization response includes clear guidance that no 
    volunteers who are not vetted by one of the organizations is allowed to provide medical treatment 
    on-site. Although you are associated with one of the organizations, some paperwork mix-up caused 
    your most recent certification to not show in the system, so you have been cleared to supervise 
    the casualty collection point but have not been cleared to actually provide medical treatment. 
    The time to medical transport to a hospital is uncertain due to road and infrastructure disruption, 
    but the current estimate is that no transport will arrive for at least one hour. One of the 
    casualties had severe blood loss which was controlled during initial triage. They now have symptoms 
    of shock and fluid resuscitation is indicated. The two medical providers on-site have not been 
    able to get an IV started successfully, and neither of them has used an intraosseous access method 
    before. They are not comfortable doing it for the first time in the field.  You have used this 
    method many times yourself. An individual approaches you, identifies themselves as being an army 
    surgeon for 20 years, and offers to help.
