    During a patrol mission at night, your unit comes under fire, and one soldier is 
    seriously injured. They are unable to walk, so must be carried in a litter. You 
    assess them as “immediate”, needing medical evaluation quickly. Your commander asks 
    you which medical evacuation option you would recommend.

          The pre-designated helicopter landing zone, through a forest. This location is 2 miles away and the 
          helicopter would be fastest. You have no direct way to contact the helicopter, so you would pass the evacuation 
          request through your base as an intermediary. You are not familiar with routes through the forest. 
          If the evacuation request is not received, or if you get lost in the forest, the patient will likely die. 
          But this is the fastest option if things go according to plan.

          Go 4 miles across some fields to meet up with a paved road. This is farther away. Once there, vehicle 
          transportation would be slower than the helicopter. You could directly contact your base to dispatch the 
          vehicle and coordinate the meet-up, so you are also certain that transport will be available. This option 
          is slower but more reliable.
