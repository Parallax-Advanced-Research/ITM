    You are treating two patients with severe injuries at a secure Casualty Collection Point. 
    Patient A is just beginning his tour of service; Patient B is one week from completing a 
    highly decorated tour of service and returning home to his family. You cannot adequately 
    treat both patients. Treating Patient A would allow him to return to service and combat, 
    contributing to current and future operations, but would allow Patient B to die. Treating 
    Patient B will allow him to return home to his family, but would allow Patient A to die 
    and create difficulties for his unit.
