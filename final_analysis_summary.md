# Insurance Dataset Determinism Analysis

## Executive Summary

I analyzed the insurance CSV data (`train-50-50.csv` and `test-50-50.csv`) to determine if there's a deterministic relationship between customer features and KDMA values. Here are the key findings:

## Key Findings

### 1. Dataset Structure
- **Choice-based scenario**: The dataset represents insurance choice scenarios where customers select from 4 options (val1-val4)
- **Perfect matching**: 100% of rows have `action_type` matching one of the val1-val4 values
- **Balanced split**: Exactly 50-50 split between 'high' and 'low' KDMA values (8,000 each)

### 2. Determinism Analysis
- **74.1% deterministic**: 7,783 customer profiles consistently produce the same KDMA value
- **25.9% stochastic**: 2,714 customer profiles show varying KDMA values for identical features
- **Mixed behavior**: The dataset is neither fully deterministic nor fully stochastic

### 3. Choice Patterns
- **Position influence**: Choice position slightly affects KDMA:
  - Position 1: 51.2% high KDMA
  - Position 2: 50.8% high KDMA  
  - Position 3: 50.0% high KDMA
  - Position 4: 47.8% high KDMA

- **Value influence**: Higher chosen values tend toward higher KDMA:
  - Low values (0-50): 47.1% high KDMA
  - Medium values (51-200): 51.6% high KDMA
  - High values (201-1000): 63.6% high KDMA
  - Very high values (1000+): 36.7% high KDMA

### 4. Stochastic Elements
- **2,714 profiles** show inconsistent KDMA values across multiple encounters
- **Customer preference variability**: Same customer profile can make different choices leading to different KDMA values
- **Example**: Customer with identical demographics may choose $1600 option (low KDMA) in one scenario and $600 option (high KDMA) in another

## Comparison with Medical Domain

| Aspect | Medical Triage | Insurance Choices |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Variables | Continuous (vital signs, lab values) | Discrete (categories, dollar amounts) |
| Uncertainty | Biological variability, measurement noise | Customer preference variability |
| Relationships | Probabilistic symptom-outcome | Mixed rule-based and preference-based |
| Stochasticity | High (~80-90%) | Moderate (~26%) |
| Determinism | Low | Moderate-High (74%) |

## XGBoost Training Implications

### Prediction: **MODERATE IMPROVEMENT**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Initial rapid learning**: XGBoost will quickly learn the 74% deterministic patterns
2. **Plateau phase**: Performance will stabilize once deterministic rules are captured
3. **Gradual improvement**: Continued training will slowly improve on the 26% stochastic cases
4. **Convergence**: Weights will plateau faster than medical domain but slower than purely deterministic systems

### Expected Training Curve:
- **Rounds 1-100**: Rapid improvement as deterministic patterns are learned
- **Rounds 100-500**: Moderate improvement on stochastic elements
- **Rounds 500+**: Minimal improvement, weights largely stabilized

## Practical Implications

1. **Training Strategy**: Use early stopping with patience to avoid overfitting on stochastic elements
2. **Feature Engineering**: Focus on customer demographic patterns that predict choice preferences
3. **Model Interpretation**: 74% of decisions follow clear rules, 26% involve preference uncertainty
4. **Performance Expectations**: High accuracy achievable but not perfect due to inherent stochasticity

## Conclusion

The insurance dataset shows **moderate stochasticity** (25.9%) compared to medical scenarios. This means:
- XGBoost weights will **not plateau immediately** (unlike purely deterministic data)
- XGBoost weights will **plateau faster than medical data** (due to 74% deterministic core)
- Optimal training will be **moderate duration** (not extremely long like medical scenarios)
- Performance will be **good but not perfect** due to inherent customer preference variability

This hybrid deterministic-stochastic nature makes the insurance domain distinct from both rule-based systems and highly uncertain medical scenarios.
