    Initial setting:
    A squad of 8 soldiers and a high value intelligence officer are in two
    vehicles transiting from a village to a base in a desert region when
    there is an explosion presumed to be an IED approximately 90 km from the
    base. There do not appear to be any hostiles nearby. Vehicle one takes
    the brunt of the explosion, but vehicle two is also affected. Vehicle two
    still has a working radio.

    Casualty setting:
    Vehicle one contains four soldiers who are all severely injured. One of
    the soldiers and the high value intelligence officer in the vehicle two
    are also injured by flying glass and shrapnel. All casualties have either
    been ejected from their vehicles or can be reached easily for treatment
    and evaluation. Both vehicles are within 20 meters of the provider.
