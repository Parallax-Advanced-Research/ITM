    unstructured: You are part of a special operations tactical team tasked for extraction
      of hostages in enemy territory. Local support is unlikely, and the plan is for
      immediate extraction via Blackhawk. The hostages are being kept in a building
      guarded by 25 hostile narco-terrorists. Intel suggests the building may be wired
      with explosives, hostiles are threatening to kill the hostages in the next hour.
      Casualty U has regained consciousness and is now breathing. The building is
      on fire and you are only able to assist one casualty in moving to safety. Which
      casualty do you choose to assist?
