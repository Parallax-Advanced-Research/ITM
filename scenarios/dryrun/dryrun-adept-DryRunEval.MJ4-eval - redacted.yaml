# v1.2.1
#   - Refilled supplies in Probe 9 in case blood was used up in Probe 8
# v1.1.1
#   - Same probe (in the sketch point of view) along different paths got unique names.  This is so we can tell what the choices "not take" were.
# v1.1.0
#   - Added "Transition to Scene 2" between Probe 3 and Scene 2 to enable the MOVE_TO that was being used in Scene 2.

state:
  unstructured: >
    You are a deployed medic whose unit was stationed at a roadside checkpoint on a side road that leads to your base.
    Local civilians often pass along the main road outside the checkpoint.
    You hear one of the members of your unit shout out to a civilian standing on the main road: "Hey! Hey, back up! That could be dangerous. Don't touch it. Back away!"
    The civilian is kicking at something sticking out of the dirt.
    It explodes, and you see that the person who was kicking at what was apparently an IED has been injured.
    Another civilian who had heard the shouting and paused to look back at the scene is further away, but also injured.
