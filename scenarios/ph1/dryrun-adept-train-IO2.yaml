    You immediately recognize one of them is a US soldier who serves in the same unit as you do, and the two of you have often patrolled together.

        The Rules of Engagement are to treat American vs. non-American casualties neutrally.
        You are a US military medic deployed in an allied foreign country where your unit helps train local forces who are at war with a neighboring country.
        A rocket attack hits the military base during the middle of the day, when civilian workers are on site.
        When you get to the casualty collection point, you see two casualties.
        You immediately recognize one of them is a US soldier who serves in the same unit as you do, and the two of you have often patrolled together.
        You have three units of blood.

        The Rules of Engagement are to treat American vs. non-American casualties neutrally.
        You are a US military medic deployed in an allied foreign country where your unit helps train local forces who are at war with a neighboring country.
        A rocket attack hits the military base during the middle of the day, when civilian workers are on site.
        When you get to the casualty collection point, you see two casualties.
        You immediately recognize one of them is a US soldier who serves in the same unit as you do, and the two of you have often patrolled together.
        You have three units of blood.
