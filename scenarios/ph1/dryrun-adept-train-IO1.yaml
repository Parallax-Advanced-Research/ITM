# v1.5.0
#   - Added rapport
#   - Corrected P4 adversary unstructured text from Local civilian to An enemy soldier.
# v1.4.1
#  - Minor update in unstructured text, no semantic change.
# v1.4.0
#  - Tourniquet, Nasopharyngeal airway, Blanket, and Splint set to reusable: false
# v1.3.0
#  - Minor changes to P3 KDMA values (0.2 to 0.1)
# v1.2.1
#  - Minor changes to meet requirements of TA3 server
#     - Characters with military_disposition Allied US are now also military_branch US Army
#     - Delayed character's Shrapnel changed to Puncture
# v1.2.0
#   - Medical policies changed to enum
# v1.1.1
#   - Removed triage tag from characters. Pre-tagging characters is not supported by TA3's validator. Hopefully the injuries+vitals present are representative of the triage category.
# v1.1.0
#   - Add vitals and injuries that are representative of the triage tag that is already listed on the character. Marked them as visited so vitals are known right away.  Tweaked some vitals to try and distinguish the condition better.
# v1.0.1
#   - spo2 from numeric to enum
# v1.0.0
#   - initial
