# v1.1.0
#   - Added rapport
#   - Corrected P4 adversary unstructured text from Local civilian to An enemy soldier.
#   - P6, P11, P16 had choices with justification that refered to a characters raport, which was not defined.  While raport is now defined, it was change to demographics.military_disposition becaues it captures the meaning closer.
# v1.0.1
#   - Fixed P6 incorrectly using relevant_state of characters with name P1 instead of P6.
# v1.0.0
#   - copied from IO1 (v1.4.0), but with "why?" justification questions added
