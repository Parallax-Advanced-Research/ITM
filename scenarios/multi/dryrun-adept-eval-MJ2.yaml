# v3.1.0
#   - Added rapport
#   - Fixed bug where probe 9-B.1, both choices were 9-B.1-A, made second one 9-B.1-B
# v3.0.2
#   - Fix typo of relevant_state Vicitim should be Victim
# v3.0.1
#   - Remove residual reference to Bennet's new injury being in the back. (A similar change had been made in other fields in an earlier version because sim doesn't support back.)
# v3.0.0
#   - Simplified opening scenes due to frequent confusion about what is going on.
#   - Edits to unstructured text/voiceover to match our internal validation study.
# v2.0.3
#   - Action identify_by_position now has relevant_state of "[characters[Victim]]" instead of ""
#   - Nasopharyngeal airway, Blanket, and Splint set to reusable: false
#   - To correctly support justify probes: conditions changed to action_conditions, condition_semantics changed to action_condition_semantics
#   - relevant_state of characters[Translator].vital corrected to characters[Translator].vitals
# v2.0.2
#   - Extended unstructured text to indicate quantity of gauze needed to treat Victim.
# v2.0.1
#   - Fix changelog, some bullets were under the wrong parent
# v2.0.0
#   - Added support for MESSAGE justify
#     - This allowed scene Probe 2 to be elaborated with more actions
#     - This allowed the scene Probe 7 and 10 to be moved into their respective predecessor scenes
#   - Fixed bug in scene Probe 2-F.1-A.1-A.1 and scene Probe 2-F.2-AB.1 that refered to directness instead of directness_of_causality
#   - Victim's puncture left chest moved to left side; hemostatic gauze doesn't properly treat chest punctures in the sim (and vented chest seal can only be applied once)
#   - Extended unstructured text of a scene to contain relevant text from previous scenes in addition to the new text for the scene.
# v1.1.1
#   - Minor changes to meet requirements of TA3 server
#     - Characters with military_disposition Allied US are now also military_branch US Army
#     - Puncture to left forearm moved to left bicep; an unspecfied injury was moved to left bicep (it wasn't availble to DM either way); removed shrapnel because it can't be internal (we were trying to represent a potential bullet inside)
# v1.1.0
#   - Remove medical policy.  It didn't seem to match with any of the enums, and the bit about where they can go is implied by the aid section.
#   - Added logic ADEPT needs for counting the amount of gauze applied (Probe 3-B.2).  This includes some places that previously had generic APPLY_TREAT now additionaly have APPLY_TREAT with params of gauze.
# v1.0.3
#   - Same probe (in the sketch point of view) along different paths got unique names.  This is so we can tell what the choices "not take" were.
# v1.0.2
#   - Fix [Go back to victim] to [Go back to Victim]
# v1.0.1
#   - Fix incorrect character ids used in Probe 10
# v1.0.0
#   - Initial

# This scenario was refered to as MD1 in eval scenario sketches.docx

state:
  unstructured: >
    You are the only combat medic with a deployed unit conducting a presence patrol around a host nation village. Your goal is to discourage criminal activity by local gangs and build trust with the local population.
    You are encouraged to provide any immediate medical assistance to injured civilians, but typically they receive any additional treatment at the village medical clinic and are not admitted to the US medical aid station on base. Civilian casualties are also typically not transported to the US Level II medical care center.
    As your squad passes the marketplace, you hear several gunshots and screaming, and see people running out of the building. After listening to a radio call, your squad leader says, "They've got this building secure. Medic, you head inside and start treating casualties. Roberts, you stay with him. The rest of you, follow me and secure the rest of the market."
    As you go into the building, you see two casualties.

        You are the only combat medic with a deployed unit conducting a presence patrol around a host nation village. As your squad passed the marketplace, you heard several gunshots and screaming, and saw people running out of the building. After listening to a radio call, your squad leader says, "They've got this building secure. Medic, you head inside and start treating casualties. Roberts, you stay with him.  The rest of you, follow me and secure the rest of the market." As you went into the building, you saw two casualties. You worked with those casualties some and then you were informed that there was a US military casualty in a different part of the market. After visiting a US military casualty, you were told that the original patients may need medical attention. You are in a room with the injured shooter and victim, who are both still alive but seriously injured.  A member of your squad indicated that both patients might go into shock. Transportation to the city hospital that has surgical capabilities is en route.

        You indicate that you want to transport the victim.
        Another medic stabalizes the victim.
        You are told that local authorities are heading to the hospital and want to question any surving gang member.

        Suddenly, Bennett, the US military member, comes into the room, helped by another member of your squad. The other member of your squad says "Bennett needs help! It looks like he must have got hit without knowing it." After removing his bullet proof vest, you see blood coming from right near the shoulder at the edge of the vest. This is slow bleeding, not major hemorrhage. You can't tell if there is a bullet lodged in his ribcage or if it bounced off or if it's somewhere in his torso. He is conscious, and his vitals are still normal. 
        Before you can start treating Bennett, another member of your squad comes in, half-carrying a local translator who works with your squad. He lays the man down and shouts for your attention, "Medic! I just found Lucas outside. This is his day off, and he was probably just shopping at the market." Lucas is gasping and you see blood from a stab wound on his chest seeping through a bandage the squad member is holding to his chest. 
        Who do you treat first?

        You are the only combat medic with a deployed unit conducting a presence patrol around a host nation village. As your squad passed the marketplace, you heard several gunshots and screaming, and saw people running out of the building. After listening to a radio call, your squad leader says, "They've got this building secure. Medic, you head inside and start treating casualties. Roberts, you stay with him. The rest of you, follow me and secure the rest of the market." As you went into the building, you saw two casualties. You worked with those casualties some and then you were informed that there was a US military casualty in a different part of the market. After visiting a US military casualty (Bennett), you were told that the original patients may need medical attention. You left Bennett to attend to other patients. You are in a room with the injured shooter and victim, who are both still alive but seriously injured. Suddenly, Bennett, the US military member, came into the room, helped by another member of your squad. The other member of your squad said, "Bennett needs help! It looks like he must have got hit without knowing it." After removing his bullet proof vest, you saw blood coming from right near the shoulder at the edge of the vest. This is slow bleeding, not major hemorrhage. You can't tell if there is a bullet lodged in his ribcage or if it bounced off or if it's somewhere in his torso. He is conscious, and his vitals are still normal. Before you could start treating Bennett, another member of your squad comes in, half-carrying a local translator who works with your squad. He laid the man down and shouted for your attention, "Medic! I just found Lucas outside. This is his day off, and he was probably just shopping at the market." Lucas was gasping and you saw blood from a stab wound on his chest seeping through a bandage that the squad member is holding to his chest. Lucas was treated. Since Lucas works with your squad, he could be evacuated to the US Level 2 medical facility for treatment. A person from your squad told you, "We have military evacuation on the way, and they can take one person. Who are you going to put on it?"
        
        You have indicated that you intend to evacuate Lucas.
        One of the members of your squad wonders about your decision.
        The military transport arrives. Who do you load?
        Why did you chose that patient?
