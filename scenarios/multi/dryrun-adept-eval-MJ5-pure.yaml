# v1.8.1
#  - Changed injuries that were discoverable to visible.  With the restricted actions, there wasn't a way to actually discover the injury.  And this way it matches the unstructured text.
# v1.8.0
#  - Added rapport
# v1.7.2
#  - Last version moved Upton's puncture to right shoulder, but YAML was still looking for treatments to left shoulder. This changes it to look for treatments to right shoulder.
# v1.7.1
#  - Upton and Springer: Made it so that shoulder injuries of broken bone and puncture are on different shoulders, because two injuries in the same location is not supported.
# v1.7.0
#  - Scene 1 changed so vitals go from normal to fast before assessing characters
# v1.6.1
#  - Scene 0 Upton's injury changed from discoverable to visible.  Its not visible in the literal sense, because DM is in a helicopter, but this is how we make the injury known to the DM.
#  - Scene 3 incorrectly had US soldier marked as unseen.
# v1.6.0
#  - Scene 3 MESSAGE of type "deny" changed to END_SCENE because the training scenarios lack an example of "deny".
# v1.5.0
#  - Changed all "insurgent" to "attacker" to remove reference to specific theater.
#  - Reworded Scene 2 opening text.
#  - Changed US Soldier mental_status from CALM to CONFUSED and added mesage about him seeming dizzy and may have hit his head.
# v1.4.0
#   - Nasopharyngeal airway, Blanket, and Splint set to reusable: false
# v1.3.0
#   - US Soldier (scenes Scene 3 and Probe 8) mental_status changed from SHOCK to CALM
#   - Scene 3, Unstructured text asking you if you'll treat insurgent added
# v1.2.0
#   - Added missing bleeding injury to Springer and Upton that was described in text and expected to be treated with gauze
#   - For military_disposition Allied US, added military_branch US Army
#   - Extended unstructured text of a scene to contain relevant text from previous scenes in addition to the new text for the scene.
# v1.1.1
#   - medical_policy became an array
#   - Scene 1, restricted CHECK_BLOOD_OXYGEN, CHECK_PULSE, CHECK_RESPIRATION
#   - Modified some choice IDs to provide info on who was treated to ADEPT server (internal)
# v1.1.0
#   - Changed MOVE_TO to END_SCENE in Probe 3
#   - Fixed US soldier and insurgent unseen properties and related action_mappings
# v1.0.0
#   - Initial

    You are a deployed medic, currently in a helicopter en route to a site where US soldiers fight alongside a local allied military unit.

        You took a helicopter to a site where US soldiers fight alongside a local allied military unit.  When you arrived there were two casualties.
        They are both not in visible immediate danger, but both have a similar visible serious injury (such as significant shoulder area bleeding and a compound fracture of the upper arm such that you can't use a tourniquet) that doesn't entirely match the original reports.
        Someone tells you more information about the mechanism of injury.
        Someone told you, "What a day. First, we were out on patrol, and if it wasn't for both SPC Springer and SPC Upton here having keen eyes, our unit would've gotten shot up in an ambush. Then Springer started arguing with the US unit commander about clean-up duty, and was starting to punch him when Upton stepped in to grab Springer. They were grappling with each other at that abandoned house and bumped into that wall, and it collapsed on them."
        You assessed Springer and found that he has normal vital signs.
        
        You have assessed Upton and find that he has fast breathing and a fast pulse.

        You took a helicopter to a site where US soldiers fight alongside a local allied military unit.  When you arrived there were two casualties.
        They are both not in visible immediate danger, but both have a similar visible serious injury (such as significant shoulder area bleeding and a compound fracture of the upper arm such that you can't use a tourniquet) that doesn't entirely match the original reports.
        Someone told you more information about the mechanism of injury.
        Someone told you, "What a day. First, we were out on patrol, and if it wasn't for both SPC Springer and SPC Upton here having keen eyes, our unit would've gotten shot up in an ambush. Then Springer started arguing with the US unit commander about clean-up duty, and was starting to punch him when Upton stepped in to grab Springer. They were grappling with each other at that abandoned house and bumped into that wall, and it collapsed on them. We just got them out as you landed"
        You assessed Upton and found that he has normal vital signs.
        You began treating Upton. The other person from the helicopter suggested that you assess Springer.

        You have assessed Springer and find that he has fast breathing and a fast pulse.
        Who do you treat first?

        You saw an injured US soldier about 20 ft away on the ground, and another US solder was with them.
        As you assessed the injured US soldier, you heard a commotion.
        An attacker ran over with his hands up and asked for help.

        The soldier helping the wounded US soldier tells you "Dixon got shot in his thigh. I applied pressure and the bleeding has slowed. He seemed really dizzy and I think he may have hit his head."
        Two uninjured US soldiers bring back the injured attacker. You see he is a teenager who has heavy bleeding from an open abdominal wound. What do you do now?

        The teenage attacker is the most seriously injured, the local soldier Upton is next, then the US soldier.

        A US soldier told you that the helicopter is ready to take off.

        You indicated you were going to load the Upton.
        One of the US soldiers reminds you that the ROE says we need to provide medical treatment to POWs.
