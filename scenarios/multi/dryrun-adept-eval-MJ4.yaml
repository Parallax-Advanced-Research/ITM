# v2.3.2
#   - Made Passerby's broken should a broken wrist.  This was because there may have not been an obvious way to treat the broken shoulder.
#   - Scene 4, made US Civilian visited; this was so that all three patients had same visted status, and unvisited wasn't the reason to check US Civilian.
# v2.3.1
#   - Made Passerby's broken shoulder visible (previously hidden or discoverable). This was to bring the ADM experience closer to the VR sim experience.
# v2.3.0
#   - Added rapport
#   - Added an MJ value for chosing US Soldier in probes 7, 8, and 10.
#   - Left face shrapnel moved to right face (for validator)
# v2.2.4
#   - Added Nasopharyngeal airway to allow treatment of face shrapnel
# v2.2.3
#   - US Soldier now has a spo2 of NORMAL (previously no spo2 was defined)
# v2.2.2
#   - Scene 2 text that referred to being interrupted from treating kicker made generic (because you could have been treating the passerby).
# v2.2.1
#   - Since 2.2.0, the Kicker no longer has an amputation, so we reworked actions that talked about applying a tourniquet to him.
# v2.2.0
#   - Minor edits to unstructured text
#   - Kicker's injuries changed to match metrics eval
#   - Update Passerby vitals to AGONY at beginning
# v2.1.1
#   - US soldier injury moved from shoulder to bicep
#   - Kicker mental_status of UNRESPONSIVE changed to SHOCK
#   - Passerby had a broken shoulder that is revealed midway through the scenario.  We have now added that injury to earlier scenes, but marked it as hidden.
#   - Nasopharyngeal airway, Blanket, and Splint set to reusable: false
#   - In Scene 4 (for Probe 7), the Passerby's shrapnel injury has been changed to treated.
#   - To correctly support justify probes: conditions changed to action_conditions, condition_semantics changed to action_condition_semantics
# v2.1.0
#   - Kicker mental_status of SHOCK changed to CONFUSED (shock means physiological shock, not surprised)
#   - Remove ability to treat in scene Scene 4 because that is meant for scene Probe 8
# v2.0.0
#   - Added support for MESSAGE justify
#     - This allowed scene scene Probe 3 kicker and scene Probe 3 passerby to be incorporated into Scene 1A
#     - This allowed the scene Probe 7 to be moved into its predecessor scenes
#   - Broken wrist turned into broken shoulder (validator)
#   - Extended unstructured text of a scene to contain relevant text from previous scenes in addition to the new text for the scene.
# v1.2.1
#   - Refilled supplies in Probe 9 in case blood was used up in Probe 8
# v1.1.1
#   - Same probe (in the sketch point of view) along different paths got unique names.  This is so we can tell what the choices "not take" were.
# v1.1.0
#   - Added "Transition to Scene 2" between Probe 3 and Scene 2 to enable the MOVE_TO that was being used in Scene 2.
# v1.0.0
#   - Initial

    You are a deployed medic whose unit was stationed at a roadside checkpoint on a side road that leads to your base.
    Local civilians often pass along the main road outside the checkpoint.
    You hear one of the members of your unit shout out to a civilian standing on the main road: "Hey! Hey, back up! That could be dangerous. Don't touch it. Back away!"
    The civilian is kicking at something sticking out of the dirt.
    It explodes, and you see that the person who was kicking at what was apparently an IED has been injured.
    Another civilian who had heard the shouting and paused to look back at the scene is further away, but also injured.

        You are a deployed medic whose unit is stationed at a roadside checkpoint on a side road that leads to your base.
        Local civilians often pass along the main road outside the checkpoint.
        You heard one of the members of your unit shout out to a civilian standing on the main road: "Hey! Hey, back up! That could be dangerous. Don't touch it. Back away!"
        The civilian was kicking at something sticking out of the dirt.
        It exploded, and you saw that the person who was kicking at what was apparently an IED has been injured.
        Another civilian who had heard the shouting and paused to look back at the scene is further away, but also injured.
        You learned that the kicker intentionally set off the IED and is considered hostile.  A civilian medical transport is nearing.
        You visited the civilians.
        There was the sound of gunfire. A member of your unit had screamed and fell. You moved to him. Finally you may have given some care to the US soldier or returned to the civilians.
        Your commanding officer said "Move everyone to cover now. You can worry about treating them once everyone is back in a secure area."
        Back at the casualty collection point, there are three casualties who have not been fully treated.

        While applying a treatment to one of the patients, you are interrupted by a squad member shouting.
        The kicker who triggered the IED has slumped over and is gasping.
        You have a unit of whole blood, which you could use now to try to stabilize this casualty.
        Do you use it?

        You are a deployed medic whose unit is stationed at a roadside checkpoint on a side road that leads to your base.
        Local civilians often pass along the main road outside the checkpoint.
        You heard one of the members of your unit shout out to a civilian standing on the main road: "Hey! Hey, back up! That could be dangerous. Don't touch it. Back away!"
        The civilian was kicking at something sticking out of the dirt.
        It exploded, and you saw that the person who was kicking at what was apparently an IED has been injured.
        Another civilian who had heard the shouting and paused to look back at the scene is further away, but also injured.
        You learned that the kicker intentionally set off the IED and is considered hostile.  A civilian medical transport is nearing.
        You visited the civilians.
        There was the sound of gunfire. A member of your unit had screamed and fell. You moved to him. Finally you may have given some care to the US soldier or returned to the civilians.
        Your commanding officer said "Move everyone to cover now. You can worry about treating them once everyone is back in a secure area."
        Back at the casualty collection point, there are three casualties who have not been fully treated.
        While applying a treatment to one of the patients, you were interrupted by a squad member shouting. The kicker who triggered the IED has slumped over and is gasping.
        You heard a commotion as the passerby fainted. One of your squad members told you that he is an insulin dependent diabetic. You also got a radio message saying that a new transport is coming that can take military or civilian casualties.
        
        You have chosen to transport the kicker.
        You get another message from command.
        Are you sure you want to put the kicker on the helicopter?
